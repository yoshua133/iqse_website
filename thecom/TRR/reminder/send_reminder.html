<textarea name="message" cols=50 rows=25 wrap=virtual>Dear Patron, 

The Townes Reading Room was established in order for books to be made available to students, researchers, and faculty for reading in the Townes Reading Room area without the burden of having to purchase these fundamental texts. For patron convenience, Books are allowed to be checked out for a 24 hour period. 

Email reminders are sent out daily to remind patrons to return the books that they might be available for others to read also. Please know a copier is available in IQSE 562 for you to use if there is a section in the book you have checked out that you need for a longer period of time. 

Thank you for helping us to keep the Townes Reading Room books available for reading by everyone.

Sincerely, 
IQSE</textarea></p>
